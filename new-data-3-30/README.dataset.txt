# Overview:
Football (soccer) player and football (soccer) ball detection dataset from [Augmented Startups](https://www.augmentedstartups.com/).
* Project Type: Object Detection
* Labeled/Annotated with: Bounding boxes

### Classes:
* `football`, `player`

## How to Use:
This is a great starter-dataset for those wanting to test player and/or ball-tracking for football (soccer) games with the [Deploy Tab](https://blog.roboflow.com/deploy-tab), or the [Deployment device and method of their choice](https://docs.roboflow.com/inference).

Images can also be [Cloned to another project](https://help.roboflow.com/dataset-upload-cloning-images-from-roboflow-universe) to continue iterating on the project and model. World Cup, Premier League, La Liga, Major League Soccer (MLS) and/or Champions League computer vision projects, anyone?

Roboflow offers AutoML model training - [Roboflow Train](https://docs.roboflow.com/train), and the ability to import and export up to [30 different annotation formats](https://roboflow.com/formats). Leaving you flexibility to deploy directly with a Roboflow Train model, or use Roboflow to prepare and manage datasets, and train and deploy with the [custom model architecture of your choice](https://models.roboflow.com) + https://github.com/roboflow-ai/notebooks.
